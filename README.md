# lifeisafractal's OpenPnP Scripts

This is a collection of my OpenPnP scripts that are written in Python for use with the [Opulo
LumenPnP](https://www.opulo.io/). These may or may not be useful for other people, use at your own
risk, but feel free to leave issues or PRs if you have them. You can also find me on the [LumenPnP
Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TCwy6De) which is likely the best way to talk about any of this
(#openpnp channel is best to discuss this, my handle is mattc8029).
